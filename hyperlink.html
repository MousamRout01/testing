<h1>saharukh khan</h1>
    <P id="srk">Shah Rukh Khan (pronounced [ˈʃɑːɦɾʊx xɑːn] ⓘ; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi films. Referred to in the media as the "Baadshah of Bollywood" and "King Khan",[a] he has appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world.[b] Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.

        Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with the musical romance Deewana. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films Baazigar (1993) and Darr (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995), Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998), Mohabbatein (2000), Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003), Veer-Zaara (2004) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in the period romantic drama Devdas (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama Swades (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama Chak De! India (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in the drama My Name Is Khan (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romances Om Shanti Om (2007) and Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in Chennai Express (2013) and Happy New Year (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers Pathaan and Jawan, both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.
        
        As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders. The media often label him as "Brand SRK" because of his many endorsements and entrepreneurship ventures. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. Khan's philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO's Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children's education and the World Economic Forum's Crystal Award in 2018 for advocating for women's and children's rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, Newsweek named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world. In 2022, Khan was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a readers' poll by Empire, and in 2023, Time named him as one of the most influential people in the world.
        
        Early life and family
        Parents
        Khan's father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India.[1][2] Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[3] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[4] He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan.[c] According to Khan his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan.[7][4][8] However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.[4][9] As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar.[4]
        
        In 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law at Delhi University.[10] When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi, and did not return to Peshawar until many years later.[11] Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[12][c][13] His parents were married in 1959.[14]
        
        Early life
        Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[15] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[16][17][d] Khan has described himself on Twitter as "half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)".[19]
        
        Khan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of New Delhi.[20] His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments.[21] Khan attended St. Columba's School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football,[22] and received the school's highest award, the Sword of Honour.[21] Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play.[23] Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Mumtaz.[24] One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress.[25] Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor's degree in economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi's Theatre Action Group (TAG),[26] where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John.[27][28] After Hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career.[29] He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.[30]
        
        His father died of cancer in 1981,[e] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.[33] After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born 1960)[34] fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her.[31][35] Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.[36]
        
        Acting career

        1988–1992: Television and film debut
        Khan's first starring role was in Lekh Tandon's television series Dil Dariya, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series Fauji becoming his television debut instead.[37] In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai.[38][39] This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza's television series Circus (1989–90) and Mani Kaul's miniseries Idiot (1992).[40] Khan also played minor parts in the serials Umeed (1989) and Wagle Ki Duniya (1988–90),[40] and in the English-language television film In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones (1989).[41] His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar,[42] but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.[40][43]
        
        Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991,[44] citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother's death.[45] He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood and was quickly signed to four films.[44] His first offer was for Hema Malini's directorial debut Dil Aashna Hai,[30][38] and by June, he had started his first shoot.[46] His film debut was in Deewana, which was released in June 1992.[47] In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. Deewana became a box office hit and launched Khan's Bollywood career;[48] he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance.[49] Also released in 1992 were Khan's first films as the male lead, Chamatkar, Dil Aashna Hai, and the comedy Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla.[50] His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of Daily News and Analysis, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was "sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next."[51]
        
        1993–1994: Anti-hero
        Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in Baazigar, and an obsessive lover in Darr.[52] The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula.[53] In The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture, Sonal Khullar called the character "the consummate anti-hero".[54] His performance in Baazigar, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[55] In 2003, the Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema stated that Khan "defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero".[55] Darr marked the first of Khan's many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan's stammering and the use of the phrase "I love you, K-k-k-Kiran" were popular with audiences.[56] Malini Mannath of The Indian Express argued that he "walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role".[57] For Darr he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for Sir.[58] Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in Maya Memsaab, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification.[59] The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.[60]
        
        In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah's comedy-drama film Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan's best performance, calling him "spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart".[61] Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in Anjaam, co-starring Madhuri Dixit.[55] At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man's career in mainstream Hindi cinema. Arnab Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking "insane risks" and "pushing the envelope" by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career.[51] The director Mukul S. Anand called him "the new face of the industry" at the time.[45]
        
        1995–1998: Romantic roles</P>


<h1>kartik aryan</h1>
    <p id="ka">Kartik Aaryan (né Tiwari; born 22 November 1990)[1] is an Indian actor who works in Hindi films. While pursuing a degree in engineering, he made his acting debut with Luv Ranjan's buddy film Pyaar Ka Punchnama (2011). He went on to star in the romances Akaash Vani (2013) and Kaanchi (2014), but these failed to propel his career forward.

        Aaryan had commercial successes in Ranjan's comedies Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 (2015) and Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety (2018), with the latter emerging as his breakthrough film. He gained further prominence by starring in the romantic comedies Luka Chuppi and Pati Patni Aur Woh (both 2019), and the comedy horror film Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 (2022). The last of these emerged as his highest-grossing release and earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. He also played against type in the thrillers Dhamaka (2021) and Freddy (2022), and the romantic drama Satyaprem Ki Katha (2023).
        
        In addition to his acting career, Aaryan endorses several brands and products, and has co-hosted award ceremonies. He appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list of 2019.
        
        Early and personal life
        Kartik Tiwari (later Aaryan)[a] was born on 22 November 1990 in Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh.[2][3] Both his parents are doctors; his father, Dr. Manish Tiwari, is a pediatrician, and his mother, Dr. Mala Tiwari, is a gynecologist.[4][5] Aaryan did his schooling at St. Paul's School in Gwalior.[6] He later pursued an engineering degree in biotechnology from D. Y. Patil College of Engineering, Navi Mumbai, while secretly harbouring ambitions for a career in film.[5][4] He has said that he would skip his classes and travel for two hours to attend auditions.[7][8]
        
        Aaryan began a modelling career while in university and after three years of unsuccessfully auditioning for films, he did an acting course from the Kreating Charakters institute. He informed his parents of his desire to become an actor only after he signed his first film.[5][9] He later completed his engineering degree at the insistence of his mother, after the release of his first film.[8][10][11]
        
        Despite media speculation, Aaryan is reluctant to speak about his romantic relationships in the media. He has said, "I've never spoken about my relationships, and I expect the same from my partner".[12]
        
        Career
        Early work (2011–2017)
        While still in his third year of college, Aaryan made his acting debut with Luv Ranjan's buddy film Pyaar Ka Punchnama (2011), co-starring Divyendu Sharma, Raayo S Bakhirta, and Nushrat Bharucha, which revolves around the romantic tribulations faced by three young men.[13][14] He found a casting call for the film on Facebook and secured the role after auditioning for six months.[5] As he had limited financial means at that point, he lived in an apartment with 12 other aspiring actors and earned money by cooking for them.[5][15] In Pyaar Ka Punchnama, his character's four-minute monologue was one of the lengthiest single shots done for a Hindi film to that point.[16] Reviewing it for Rediff.com, Shaikh Ayaz found Aaryan's "bursting soliloquy on why women are the way they are and can never be understood [to be] riotously funny".[17] Namrata Joshi of Outlook criticised the film for portraying each of the female characters as a "hard-hearted bitch" but was appreciative of Aaryan's monologue and the chemistry between the three men.[18] The film emerged as a sleeper hit and he received a nomination for the Producers Guild Film Award for Best Male Debut.[19][20]
        
        
        Aaryan at an event for his film Kaanchi in 2014
        His next film release came two years later when he collaborated once again with Ranjan and Bharucha in the romance Akaash Vani (2013), which is about the titular lovers who are separated when Vani is married off to an abusive husband.[21][22] Sudhish Kamath of The Hindu praised the film for exploring chauvinism in India, a rare concept for Hindi film, and praised the chemistry between the two stars, writing that "you can tell how much they are in love, even when they don't have any lines".[23] Sudhir Chaudhary, the cinematographer in Aaryan's previous films, showed his work to Subhash Ghai, who was impressed by Aaryan and cast him in his directorial Kaanchi (2014).[9] It is a drama about a woman's quest for justice when her husband is murdered by politicians, in which Aaryan played the love interest of the title character (played by Mishti). Despite a brief role, Aaryan agreed to the project to work with Ghai.[9] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV disliked the film but wrote that Aaryan "exudes strong screen presence and shows flashes of qualities needed to be a mainstream Bollywood lover boy".[24] Both Akaash Vani and Kaanchi did not perform well commercially, leading Aaryan to question his career prospects.[25][10]
        
        In 2015, Aaryan starred in Ranjan's comedy sequel Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2, which retained some of the original's cast, including him and Bharucha, and added the actors Omkar Kapoor and Sunny Singh. In it, he delivered an even longer, seven minute single-shot monologue.[26][27] Mike McCahill of The Guardian criticised the film's poor handling of female roles, but considered the banter between Aaryan and Bharucha's characters to be its highlight.[28] Shubha Shetty-Guha of Mid-Day too took note of the misogynistic themes but found parts of it "uproariously funny".[29] When asked about the sexism in the film, Aaryan said that as a proponent of gender equality his character did not reflect his personal beliefs.[30] With earnings of over ₹880 million (US$11 million) against a budget of ₹220 million (US$2.8 million), Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2 emerged as a major financial success.[31] For his performance, Aaryan won a Stardust Award for Best Actor In A Comic Role.[32]
        
        The following year, Aaryan featured as a young Muslim boy who falls in love with an older woman in Tanuja Chandra's short film Silvat, which was made as part of the Zeal For Unity initiative to bridge cultural barriers between India and Pakistan.[33][34] As he enjoyed working in comedies, Aaryan next starred alongside Paresh Rawal and Kriti Kharbanda in Guest iin London (2017), which is about a young couple troubled by unwelcome guests.[35] A few scenes between Rawal and him were improvised on set.[35] In a scathing review, Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times criticised the film's reliance on flatulence humour, and wrote that Aaryan "looks good, dances well, does his gags well, but eventually ends up playing the second fiddle to Rawal. Kartik has a likeable vibe, but that gets drowned in Rawal's perennial farting."[36] It did not perform well commercially.[37]
        
        Breakthrough (2018–2021)
        Aaryan's breakthrough came in 2018 when he collaborated with Ranjan and Bharucha for the fourth time in Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety, which also reunited him with Singh.[38][39] The film tells the story of Sonu (Aaryan) who plots to separate his best friend Titu (Singh) from his fiancée Sweety (Bharucha) as Sonu considers her to be a gold digger. As with the Pyaar Ka Punchnama films, reviewers criticised the film's misogyny;[40] Anna M. M. Vetticad of Firstpost took note of the film's homosexual undertones but panned it as a "dreary woman-hate-fest" and thought that Aaryan was "tiresome and hammy" in it.[41] Rajeev Masand too disliked the "objectionable stereotyping" of women but found it to be "unquestionably funny" and credited Aaryan for making his character a "relatable, likeable figure despite his misdeeds".[42] Once again addressing the criticisms, Aaryan said that portraying women as negative characters did not amount to misogyny just as casting men in villainous roles did not amount to misandry.[3][43] With earnings of ₹1.5 billion (US$19 million), the film emerged as Aaryan's biggest success.[44][45] He won the Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Comic Role.[46]
        
        
        Aaryan and Kriti Sanon in 2019
        Aaryan believed that the success of Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety allowed him to choose from a wider variety of roles. He was drawn to Luka Chuppi (2019), a satire on live-in relationships in small-town India, for depicting social issues through comedy.[47] Co-starring Kriti Sanon, it was filmed in his hometown of Gwalior.[48] Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express criticised the writing for failing to subvert the issues raised in the film, and thought that both Aaryan and Sanon "come off standard-issue Bollywood".[49] He next starred alongside Bhumi Pednekar and Ananya Panday in the comedy Pati Patni Aur Woh, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name. He took on the part of a philandering husband, which was played by Sanjeev Kumar in the original film.[50] Anupama Chopra considered the film to be less misogynistic than the original; she wrote that Aaryan "enthusiastically commits" to his part but added that he had been overshadowed by his leading ladies.[51] Both Luka Chuppi and Pati Patni Aur Woh were commercially successful, each grossing over ₹1 billion (US$13 million) worldwide.[52][53] For the latter, he won his second consecutive Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Comic Role.[54]
        
        Imtiaz Ali's romantic drama Love Aaj Kal, a spiritual successor to Ali's 2009 film of the same name was Aaryan's sole film release of 2020.[55] He played dual roles of young men in 1990 and 2020, opposite Arushi Sharma and Sara Ali Khan, respectively, after working on the mannerisms and body language of the characters to differentiate them from each other.[56][57] In a negative review of the film, Nandini Ramnath of Scroll.in wrote that Aaryan "nails the diffidence and callowness of his characters" but bemoaned that he lacked "brooding quality and simmering intensity" in certain scenes.[58] It emerged as a box office bomb.[59]
        
        Aaryan was cast by Dharma Productions in the comedy sequel Dostana 2, but after filming for 20 days, he was fired.[60] Bollywood Hungama reported that it was due to creative differences between him and producer Karan Johar.[61][62] In 2021, Aaryan starred in Ram Madhvani's thriller Dhamaka, a remake of the Korean film The Terror Live (2013). Filmed entirely in 10 days, it was released on Netflix.[63][64] Stutee Ghosh of The Quint believed Aaryan's dark, against-type performance to be among the film's positive aspects.[65]
        
        Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 and beyond (2022–present)
        In 2022, Aaryan starred as Rooh Baba, a fraudulent psychic, in Anees Bazmee's horror comedy Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 with Tabu and Kiara Advani.[66] He temporarily lost his voice while filming its climax sequence.[67] In a mixed review, Shalini Langer of The Indian Express noted that Aaryan's "cockiness [and] enthusiasm... lends some much-needed energy to the film".[68] The film emerged as his highest-grossing release, with worldwide earnings of over ₹2.67 billion (US$33 million).[69][70] He won the Zee Cine Critics Award for Best Actor – Male and received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.[71][72] He next played the titular role of a socially awkward dentist with a dark past in the psychological thriller Freddy, which released on Disney+ Hotstar.[73] In preparation, he gained 14 kg, observed a dentist at work, and lived in isolation.[74] Reviewers for India Today and Hindustan Times were appreciative of Aaryan for playing against his comic and romantic image.[75][76]
        
        In 2023, Aaryan starred in a remake of the Telugu action film Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo (2020), titled Shehzada.[77] When the film's producers suffered a financial crisis, Aaryan returned his salary, and was thus credited as producer.[78] The film was a critical and commercial failure.[79] Reacting to its reception, Aaryan said that he would not work in a remake again.[80] He reunited with Kiara Advani in Satyaprem Ki Katha, a romantic drama about a troubled marriage.[81] Although Nandini Ramnath wrote that "Aaryan puts visible effort" into a complex role and Sukanya Verma believed that he "sparkles in certain moments of vulnerability", they both opined that he had been overshadowed by Advani.[82][83] It emerged as a modest commercial success.[84]
        
        Aaryan will next star in Kabir Khan's Chandu Champion, a sports film based on the life of Paralympic swimmer Murlikant Petkar.[85] He will also reprise his role as Rooh Baba in the sequel Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3.[86]
        
        Other work and media image
        
        Aaryan in 2019
        In addition to acting in films, Aaryan endorses several brands and products, including the sportswear brand Hummel International, the cream Emami Fair And Handsome and the clothing brand Manyavar.[87][88][89] He has also co-hosted the 2018 IIFA Awards with Ayushmann Khurrana, and the 2019 Zee Cine Awards with Vicky Kaushal.[90][91]
        
        In 2016, Aaryan became a member of the All Stars Football Club, which organises football matches for charity.[92] He participated with several other celebrities, including Ranbir Kapoor, for a tournament held in New Delhi the following year.[93] Aaryan was scheduled to take part in the club's next tournament, held in Singapore in 2018, but had to back out after dislocating his toe during practice.[94] In 2018, Aaryan raised awareness on plastic pollution during World Environment Day.[95] The following year, the Election Commission of India appointed him to raise awareness on voter participation in his home state of Madhya Pradesh.[96]
        
        Aaryan was placed eighth in The Times of India's listing of the country's most desirable men of 2018.[97] He held the 12th spot in the next two years.[98] In 2019, he appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list, ranking 67th with an estimated annual income of ₹103.8 million (US$1.3 million).[99][100] In 2021, he ranked 20th in Duff & Phelps's listing of the country's most valuable celebrity brands.[101] In 2022, he was ranked 15th in GQ India's "30 most influential young Indians" list.[102]
